<!-- TODO for this Challenge Project-->
# 1. Use nth child for the background colors on the sections. (Use Google for some hints on this, or checkout the bonus video I made for you) <!--* Done -->

# 2. Add a section at the bottom as a footer letting your friend know that you coded this yourself using One Month! Like - "I coded this myself for you using <!--<a href="www.onemonth.com" target="_blank">One Month</a>"--> Just a suggestion. : )

# 3. Solve this problem: When there is only the unicorn image in the <!--<section>--> the layout breaks. Why? <!--* Done -->

# 4. View the site on at least one mobile device. What's working? What might still be improved? Ask questions and be curious

# 5. Get it live and share it with your friends! Then tweet it to @onemonthedu and @castig. See the bonus videos on hosting and FTP for some training on how to get your site live
